# PTCGO Auto Redeemer (simple)

This solution is a simplified and slightly enhanced version of the [Pokemart Auto Redeemer solution](https://github.com/auriorx/pokemart-auto-redeemer).

# Preparation
Before auto redeeming the codes, make sure you've opened PTCGO, make sure that:
- PTCGO is running on your **primary** monitor (if applicable)
- PTCGO is running in **windowed** mode, but uses all the space of the primary monitor.

# Execution
